## What Is This?

**d.o. Gist Hub** is a production-ready Progressive Web App for managing GitHub Gists — built for developers who need their snippets available offline, on mobile, and across devices. It combines a strict token-driven design system with resilient offline-first architecture.

**Key Features**:

- ✓ **Token-Driven Design**: DTCG-aligned design tokens with 7 breakpoints (320px–1536px+).
- ✓ **Mobile-First**: Bottom sheet navigation, `100dvh` dynamic viewport, safe area support.
- ✓ **Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K`) for rapid navigation and actions.
- ✓ **Actionable Empty States**: Guided CTAs instead of dead ends — every empty state offers a next step.
- ✓ **Hardened Security**:
  - **AES-GCM Encryption**: Personal Access Tokens encrypted at rest (Web Cryptography API).
  - **Strict CSP**: No `unsafe-inline`, restricted origins.
  - **Auto-Redaction**: Sensitive data automatically redacted from logs and UI.
- ✓ **Resilient Architecture**:
  - **AbortController Lifecycle**: Auto-cleanup of subscriptions and cancellation of in-flight requests.
  - **Layered Error Boundaries**: No silent failures; graceful recovery.
  - **Offline-First**: IndexedDB source of truth, optimistic writes, sync queue with exponential backoff.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| App Shell | Vite + TypeScript 5.5+ (strict mode) |
| UI | Vanilla TS + DTCG-aligned CSS tokens |
| Storage | IndexedDB via `idb` library |
| Security | Web Cryptography API (AES-GCM) |
| HTTP | Native Fetch + AbortController |
| PWA | Service Worker + Manifest |
| Android | Capacitor 6 |
| Testing | Playwright (cross-browser, mobile emulation, offline) |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ (with npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 2.30+
- (Optional) [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for faster installs

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/d-o-hub/do-gist-hub.git
cd do-gist-hub

# Install dependencies
npm install        # or: pnpm install

# Set up AI agent skills
./scripts/setup-skills.sh

# Start development server
npm run dev        # or: pnpm dev
```

### Verify

```bash
# Run all quality checks (typecheck + lint + format)
npm run check      # or: pnpm check

# Run the full quality gate
./scripts/quality_gate.sh
```

### Build & Package

```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Package for Android
npm run build:android
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic: Create a Gist

1. Open the app and enter your GitHub PAT in Settings.
2. Tap **New Gist** (or press `Ctrl+K` → "Create Gist").
3. Add files, set description, choose public/secret.
4. Save — works offline, syncs when online.

### Advanced: Command Palette

Press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K`) to open the command palette. Type to filter:

- `create` — New gist
- `starred` — View starred gists
- `settings` — Open settings
- `export` — Backup all gists to JSON
- `import` — Restore from JSON backup

### Quality Gate (Automatic)

```bash
# Pre-commit hook runs automatically if installed
git commit -m "feat: add gist filtering"

# Or run manually
./scripts/quality_gate.sh
```

### Optional: Rehearse GitHub Actions Locally

Catch CI errors before pushing by running workflows locally with [`nektos/act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) and **Docker**:

```bash
# Run the default CI workflow locally
./scripts/run_act_local.sh

# Run only one job (for faster feedback)
ACT_JOB=quality-gate ./scripts/run_act_local.sh
```
